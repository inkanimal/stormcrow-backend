# Stormcrow Backend

This is the rails server for my final react-redux project. This is a weather app that uses the Dark Sky api and Google geocoding api to get weather locally and across many different cities.

This app uses Ruby 2.6.2 and Rails 6.0.0

Fork and clone this repo and then 
Run $ bundle install
Run $ rake db:migrate

After migration run rails s -p3001
